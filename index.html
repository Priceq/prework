                <strong><small> I grew up in a very homogenized place. Wisconsin is where I'm from but with the help of nat geo and the history channel I grew up knowing that there was a much bigger world. I knew tht I had to see. I took every chance to go travel, and I recommend YOU do the same.</small>

                <h1>Seek </h1>
                <strong><small> I believe in doing things and making yourself feel uncomfortable. We live one life. A short one. So seek knowledge. Never stop learning and observing and absorbing and sometimes deflecting. Seek to seek so that you can seek some more. </small></strong>

                I often think about the time I spent in Korea. The food and the people were amazing, and their culture was warm and strong.</small>

                <h1>Who am I? </h1>
                <strong><small> My name is Niko. Born and raised in Milwaukee, WI. My mother raised me alone, but always taught me to shoot for the stars. I studied International Relations at as small private college and dreamed of working in an embassy or intelligence. To work toward this goal I moved to South Korea, one of the countries I focused on in undergrad. There I ultimately decided to embark on a much more stable career path and therefore I enrolled in Coding Temple.
